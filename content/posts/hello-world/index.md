Welcome to my blog. This is the very first post — a quick introduction and a test of the site's features.

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next

I'll be writing about software engineering, tools I find useful, and things I learn along the way. Stay tuned.
